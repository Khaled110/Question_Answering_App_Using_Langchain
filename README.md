## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a semantic search system for articles using Natural Language 
Processing techniques. The system aims to enable users to search for articles based on the semantic 
similarity of their content to a given query then to extract the hot keywords of that document using
keywords extractions techniques.

## Introduction
* LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It is a library that helps developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) by providing a framework for connecting LLMs to other sources of data, such as the internet or your personal files. This allows developers to chain together multiple commands to create more complex applications. I highly recommend this [crash course](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/1/introduction) from OpenAI to know more about it.
* In this Notebook we just execute a simple task using LangChain by building a simple Question Answering using BLOOM LLM from Huggingface and also with capability to use OpenAI in that task.
* After that we deployed it in a streamlit app.
